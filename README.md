# Vmail-Email-delivery-system

Vmail-Email-Delivery-System is a web-based email application developed using JavaServer Pages (JSP), serving as a robust platform for sending, receiving, and managing emails. This project aims to emulate the functionalities of conventional email services, offering users a seamless communication experience within a secure and user-friendly interface.

The system is built on a multi-tier architecture that includes a presentation layer (JSP), a business logic layer (Java servlets and classes), and a data access layer (JDBC). The back-end utilizes a relational database (MySQL) to store user information, emails, and attachments, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval.

Key features of Vmail include:

**User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

**Compose and Send Emails:** A rich text editor allows users to compose emails with attachments, enabling a versatile communication method.

**Inbox Management:** Users can receive, read, and manage their emails, including functionalities to mark emails as read/unread, delete.

**Search:** Advanced search options to help users find specific emails quickly.

**Drafts and Sent Items:** Users can save drafts and review sent emails, ensuring they have a record of their communication.
